Project: TetrisML1v1

This repository contains a frontend built with Vite + React (located in `frontend/clouddev`) and some game code under `frontend/gamedev`.

Run the frontend:

1. From project root:
   npm run install:all
   npm run dev

The dev server will start and print a local URL (for example http://localhost:5176/).

See `frontend/README.md` and `frontend/clouddev/README.md` for more details. The root `package.json` includes helper scripts that forward to `frontend/clouddev` so you can run the frontend from the repo root.
